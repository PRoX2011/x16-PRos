## üõ† Adding programs
x16 PRos includes a small set of built-in programs. You can add your own program to the system image and then run it using the `load` command, specifying the disk sector number where you wrote the program as an argument.

Here's how you can add a program:
```bash
dd if=YourProgram.bin of=disk_img/x16pros.img bs=512 seek=DiskSector conv=notrunc
```

You can read more about the software development process for x16-PRos on the project website:
[x16-PRos web site](https://x16-pros.netlify.app/)

---

## üõ† Compilation
First, clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/PRoX2011/x16-PRos.git
```
To compile the project you will only need NASM. 
Example command for Debian-based systems:
```bash
sudo apt install nasm
```
And finally:
```bash
chmod +x build-linux.sh
./build-linux.sh
```
---

## üöÄ Launchng

To launch x16 PRos, use emulators such as **QEMU**,**Bochs** or online emulator like [v86](https://copy.sh/v86/). 
Example command for **QEMU**:
```bash
qemu-system-x86_64 -fda x16-PRos-disk-image.img
```
You can also try running x16-PRos on a **real PC** (preferably with BIOS, not UEFI)

If you still want to run x16-PRos on a UEFI PC, you will need to enable "CSM support" in your BIOS. It may be called slightly differently.

## ‚öô Running x16-PRos on windows

### Installation Steps

1. Open PowerShell as Administrator and run:
```powershell
winget install nasm
winget install qemu
```

2. Add NASM and QEMU to the system PATH by running:
```powershell
setx PATH "%PATH%;C:\Program Files\NASM;C:\Program Files\qemu"
```

3. Reboot your PC for the PATH changes to take effect.

4. Run the build script:
```batch
build-windows.bat
```

**Note**: Make sure to restart your terminal or IDE after modifying the PATH variable.

### Troubleshooting
- If commands are not recognized, verify the installation paths
- Ensure PowerShell was run as Administrator during installation
- Check if PATH was updated correctly by running `echo %PATH%`
